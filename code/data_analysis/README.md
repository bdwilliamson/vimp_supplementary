# Running the data analysis for the general `vimp` paper

This file describes how to reproduce the data analysis in the "A unified approach to nonparametric variable importance assessment" by Williamson, Gilbert, Carone, and Simon. While the code in this file assumes that the user is submitting batch jobs to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster using the Slurm batch scheduing system, minor edits to these commands allow the use of either local or alternative HPC cluster environments.
